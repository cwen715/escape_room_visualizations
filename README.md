# Escape Room Interest Visualizations

This is the repo for choropleth maps made using Geopandas created to visualize how interest in escape rooms has grown over time.

In order to turn the produced PNGs into a gif, they first need to be converted to JGP using sips and then into a gif using ImageMagick.
